title: "Jazz Choice App Using psychTestR"

[Presentation](psychTestR-525-document.Rmd)

I created a melodic choice task using the new psychTestR package for presenting experimental stimuli in Shiny. The above is a presentation given for Penn State's "Transparent, Open, and Reproducible Research Practices in the Social and Behavioral Sciences" course. The app itself is available in my Github repo at <https://github.com/hannah-merseal/jazz-choice-task>.
